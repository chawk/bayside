## Philosophy

  The entire philosophy behind Bayside is to do the absolute minimum for the developer.  
  The main idea is to prevent as much black box magic as possible so the developer has 
  absolute control. 

  Bayside is not a full stack framework.   If you want it to be a single page 
  application using Angular, React or Knockout, well that's up to you.  If 
  you wish it to be a standard content website that's up to you as well.   
  Do whatever you want with Bayside.
